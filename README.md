# Priority_Queue-Heap-


A priority queue implemented as a heap based array.

How to build/use:
  1.  You must include the class as: #include "Priority_Queue.hpp"
  2.  The class can be delcared as: PriorityQueue* pq = new PriorityQueue();
  3.  The interface (members and methods) can be seen in PriorityQueue.h header file.  

Improvements:
  1. Separate the interface and implementation into Priority_Queue.hpp and Priority_Queue.cpp files respectivley
  2. Make priority queue more flexible by creating a template based class
